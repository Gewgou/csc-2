Number System Converter 🔢

This project was developed as part of my private programming lessons at Computer Science Center (csc.gr).
It is a simple JavaScript console application that allows the user to convert numbers between different bases.

Features ✨

Binary ➝ Decimal conversion

Decimal ➝ Binary conversion

Decimal ➝ Hexadecimal conversion

The program uses user input through the prompt-sync library and applies basic mathematical operations (division, modulo, and powers) to perform the conversions without relying on built-in methods.

What I Learned 📚

Through this project, I gained practical experience with:

Handling user input in Node.js

Implementing loops and conditional checks

Applying number theory to binary and hexadecimal systems

Using arrays and strings to build and display results

Strengthening my understanding of base conversion algorithms

This was an excellent exercise in improving my problem-solving skills and building confidence in JavaScript fundamentals.
